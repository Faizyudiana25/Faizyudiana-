cnc milling
A CNC Milling project is a project that involves the use of a CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine to produce components or parts that are carved or cut from hard materials, such as metal, wood, or plastic. A CNC Milling machine is driven by a computer and utilizes a numerical command program (G-code) to control the movement of its cutting tool.
